We closely follow the wlroots [contributing] guidelines where possible. Please
see that document for more information.

## Tooling

Useful tools include `dbus-monitor` to watch requests being made,
and `dbus-send` and the similar `busctl call` for manual dbus calls.

You can test the integration with the [portal-test] Flatpak app.

Alternatively you can trigger it with [trigger-screen-shot.py] and
[xdp-screen-cast.py].
